## 📝 **Task 7: Superstore Sales Summary – SQLite & Python**

### **Objective**
The objective of this task was to analyze the Superstore sales data using SQL inside Python to get basic sales summaries like total quantity sold, total revenue, and visualize the results using print statements and a basic bar chart.

---

### 🧰 **Tools Used**
- **Python**
  - `sqlite3` for SQLite database operations
  - `pandas` for data manipulation
  - `matplotlib` for creating the bar chart
- **SQLite** (built-in Python database, no external setup required)

---

### 📁 **Dataset Overview**
- **Source**: A small SQLite database (`sales_data.db`) containing sales information.
- **Features**: Product, quantity sold, price, and revenue for each sale.
- **Goal**: Summarize the sales data to extract the total quantity sold and total revenue per product.

---

### ✅ **Task Summary**

#### 📥 **1. Data Import & Setup**
- Created an SQLite database file named **`sales_data.db`**.
- The database contains a table **`sales`** with columns: `product`, `quantity`, and `price`.
- Inserted mock sales data into the database to simulate a real-world scenario.

#### 🛠 **2. SQL Query for Summary**
The SQL query used to calculate the **total quantity sold** and **total revenue** per product is:

```sql
SELECT product, 
       SUM(quantity) AS total_qty, 
       SUM(quantity * price) AS revenue 
FROM sales 
GROUP BY product
```

- This query retrieves the total sales and revenue for each product by grouping the data by product name.

#### 📊 **3. Data Retrieval & Visualization**
- Used **pandas** to run the SQL query and load the results into a DataFrame.
- Displayed the results using **print** and visualized them with a **matplotlib** bar chart showing revenue by product.

#### 📈 **4. Bar Chart**
- Generated a bar chart that displays the total revenue for each product.
- Saved the bar chart as an image: `sales_chart.png`.

---

### 📎 **Deliverables**
- **sales_summary.py**: Python script that:
  - Connects to the SQLite database.
  - Runs the SQL query to calculate total quantity sold and revenue.
  - Displays the results and generates the bar chart.
- **sales_data.db**: SQLite database with sales data.
- **sales_chart.png**: Bar chart visualizing the revenue by product.
- **README.md**: Summary and explanation of the task.

---

### 💬 **Summary of Changes**
- Created a simple SQLite database (`sales_data.db`) with sales data.
- Wrote a SQL query to calculate the total quantity sold and total revenue per product.
- Used **pandas** to run the query and retrieve data.
- Visualized the data using **matplotlib** to generate a bar chart of revenue by product.

---

### ✅ **Outcome**
- Successfully created a **cleaned dataset** with summarized sales data.
- Generated an insightful **bar chart** showing the total revenue by product.
- Showcased the ability to use SQL within Python for data retrieval and analysis.

---

### 💡 **What I Learned**
This task helped me understand how to:
- Interact with SQLite databases in Python.
- Run SQL queries inside Python scripts to extract useful information.
- Summarize data and create basic visualizations with **matplotlib**.
- Build a simple, reproducible analysis pipeline for sales data.
