# Task 5: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) - Titanic Dataset

## 🎯 Objective
Perform exploratory data analysis on the Titanic dataset to extract insights through visual and statistical exploration.

## 🛠 Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook (GitHub Codespaces)

## 📚 Contents
- Data Loading and Initial Exploration (`.info()`, `.describe()`, `.value_counts()`)
- Visualizations:
  - Histograms
  - Boxplots
  - Scatterplots
  - Pairplots (`sns.pairplot()`)
  - Heatmaps (`sns.heatmap()`)
- Observations and insights after each visualization
- Final Summary of Key Findings

## 📂 Files Included
- `task5-eda-titanic.ipynb` : Jupyter Notebook containing the complete EDA process
- `task5-eda-titanic.pdf` : Exported PDF report of the notebook
- `titanic.csv` : Dataset used for the analysis

## 📝 Summary
The EDA provided valuable insights into factors affecting survival rates on the Titanic, identified missing data issues, and explored correlations between variables such as class, gender, and fare.  
Through visualizations and statistical analysis, we could observe significant patterns that influenced passenger survival.
