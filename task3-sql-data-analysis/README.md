Absolutely! Here's your **Task 3: SQL for Data Analysis - Internship Project** README, rewritten in the same structured and professional tone, **tailored for your SQLite version** of the project:

# 📊 Task 3: SQL for Data Analysis - Internship Project (SQLite Version)

## 📌 Objective  
Perform data analysis using **SQL queries** on an **Ecommerce Demo Database** implemented in **SQLite**. Extract insights, build reusable views, optimize with indexes, and demonstrate advanced SQL skills using SQLite.

---

## 🧰 Tools Used  
- SQLite 3  
- DB Browser for SQLite / SQLite CLI  

---

## 📁 Dataset  
The database was created using a custom schema and sample data inserted via script:

- [`ecommerce-schema.sql`] – Schema + data import  
- [`ecommerce-demo.db`] – Final SQLite database

---

## 📜 SQL Concepts Applied  
- `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`, `GROUP BY`  
- SQL JOINS (`INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`)  
- Common Table Expressions (CTEs)  
- Aggregate Functions: `SUM()`, `AVG()`, `COUNT()`  
- View Creation for Modular Queries  
- Indexing for Performance Optimization  
- Simulated Stored Procedures using query parameterization  
- Workaround Window Functions: `RANK()` logic with `LIMIT`, `ORDER BY`

---

## ✅ Key Queries  
- Total quantity sold by product  
- Total spending per customer  
- Orders placed in the last 7 days  
- Best-selling products (ranked by quantity)  
- Customer segmentation based on total spend  
- Views for streamlined dashboard queries  
- Top-N spending customers (manual approach via `LIMIT`)  

---

## 📎 Deliverables  
- `task3_sql_analysis.sql` → All queries grouped by category  
- `output/` folder → Screenshots of query results (PNG)  
- `ecommerce-schema.sql` → Database creation and data insert  
- `ecommerce-demo.db` → Final SQLite database file  
- `Task3_SQL_Report.pdf` → Final documentation with query + result screenshots  
- `README.md` → Project overview (this file)

---

## 💡 Outcomes  
- Mastered advanced SQL with a focus on SQLite compatibility  
- Demonstrated ability to translate MySQL-based logic to SQLite  
- Gained experience building clean, modular, and optimized SQL code  
- Created a polished submission ideal for portfolio and internship evaluation
