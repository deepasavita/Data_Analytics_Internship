Internship Project – Airbnb NYC Data Cleaning and Visualization 

📌 Objective
Perform data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and data visualization on the Airbnb NYC 2019 dataset using Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib) to derive insights and present patterns.

🧰 Tools & Libraries Used
Python (Jupyter Notebook / GitHub Codespaces)

Pandas

Matplotlib

Seaborn

📁 Dataset
AB_NYC_2019.csv – Raw dataset containing Airbnb listings in NYC for 2019

cleaned_airbnb_nyc_2019.csv – Final cleaned dataset (output)

🧼 Data Cleaning Performed
Handled missing values in reviews_per_month

Removed rows with missing host_name or name

Dropped unnecessary column last_review

Exported the cleaned dataset for future use
